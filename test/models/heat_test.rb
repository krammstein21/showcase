# Comprehensive tests for the Heat model which represents individual dance heats
# in competitions. Heat is critical for scoring and categorization as it:
#
# - Manages heat numbers (integer conversion and validation)
# - Determines dance categories with complex extension logic
# - Delegates entry information (lead, follow, partner, etc.)
# - Implements the complete scrutineering system for scoring
# - Handles associations with scores, solos, entries, and dances
#
# Tests cover:
# - Basic Heat functionality (number handling, dance_category method)
# - Category resolution with extensions based on heat numbers
# - Delegated methods to entry (lead, follow, partner, etc.)
# - Complete scrutineering rules implementation (Rules 1, 5-11)
# - Association management and dependent destruction
#
# Scrutineering system reference:
# https://www.dancepartner.com/articles/dancesport-skating-system.asp

# Instructions for visiting studios

Studios will be asssigned a user id, and will be sent an email to reset their password.
Feel free to share that user and password with studio staff.

Event databases are backed up, and every access is authenticated and logged.  If for any
reason you lose control of your id, let us know and your password will be reset and
the logs will be examined and unapproved changes will be undone.

Each event has a home page.  You are encouraged to bookmark this page in your browser.  Feel free
to access this page anywhere: desktop, laptop, tablet, and even your phone.

At the top right of the page will be a francise logo.  Click on it to return to the home page the event.

At the top left of some pages will be a green â“˜ symbol.  Click on it to get help.

Look for a green Studios button.  This will take you to where you will do most of your work.

## Studios

On the studios page you will see a list of studios.  If your studio is not there, click on
the "New studio" button to add it.  If you have a second studio, when you add it you can pair
the studio with the first studio which enables students and instructors to dance with others
in either studio.

As a visiting studio, you will undoubtedly be invoicing your students at different rates than
the event host to cover your costs.  Click on "Override student prices (for payments to studio)"
to enter your costs.

When done, click on Create Studio.

## Adding people to your studio

Click on a studio name to see a list of participants for that studio.

From that page, C=click on Add Person to add Professionals, Students, and Guests to your list.
It generally is best to add Professionals before students.

Names work best if entered as last name first and some of the generated results will
be sorted by this name and this will place most couples packages together.

For leaders, don't worry about back numbers, this will be assigned later.

In general, don't change the registration package as the default has already been set up
correctly for your studio.

Click on Create Person to complete the process for each person you want to add.

## Adding entries to a student

Clicking on a student's name will show the information and entries for a student.

Most important is the three buttons on the top right.

Click on Add heats to enter freestyle
events from an entry form.  From this page you can override the age and level for the dances
you will select below.  Click on Create Entry when done.

Click on Add solos to enter a solo routine.

Click on Add formation to enter a solo where there are more than two dancers on the floor.
Some places call this a cabaret.

## Changing entries

If you hover your cursor over the list of entries for a student and edit button will appear.
Click on it to modify entries.  A the bottom of the entries page there will generally be a button
which can be used to either delete or scratch entries depending on whether the entries have
been scheduled yet.

Editing an entry can be a quick and easy way to change all of the dances with one instructor to
another instructor.

Lower down on the page for a student is a list of heats.  Initially all new entries will be
assigned a heat number of 0.  Assigning heat numbers is done later by the event staff.

Hovering your cursor over an individual heat will cause an edit button to appear.  This can be
a quick way to change an individual dance from one instructor to another.

## Reports

At the bottom of the page for each studio are buttons to generate reports.  From here you
can see an invoice for your studio as well as invoices you can send to your students.
Heat sheets and scores can be obtained from here too.

Scheduling is generally done by going to the heats page and clicking the redo button.

The settings page allows you to set the times between heats, the number of couples on the floor, and control the extent to which advanced and newcomers can be on the floor at the same time.

The agenda page can be used to organize the entire event, and adjust limits on a per agenda item basis.

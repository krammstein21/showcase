# Getting Started Guide for Event Organizers

Welcome to the Showcase Application! This guide will walk you through setting up and running your first ballroom dance showcase event from start to finish.

Following is a description of the steps needed for a typical, largish event. This program has also been used successfully by multiple studio owners for same day in studio events.

Be aware that this application has a lot of features and options. Every option is there because some studio owner at some time asked for it. Just because some studio owner asked for some feature for their event doesn't mean that you have to use every feature in your event. Use only what you need.

## Before You Begin

This guide assumes you have:

- Received your event ID and set up your password
- Basic familiarity with ballroom dance terminology (see our [Glossary](./Glossary))
- An entry form or list of dances you want to offer

**First time organizing a showcase?** This application handles everything from registration to scoring to heat scheduling automatically. You focus on the dance event - we handle the logistics.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup (1-2 weeks before registration opens)

### Step 1: Configure Event Settings
<div class="step" markdown="1">

1. **Navigate to Settings** from your main event page
2. **Fill in Event Details**:
   - Event name, date, location
   - Review options
   - Choose Scoring

3. **Set Up Packages** (if using invoicing):
   - Create dance packages and options for students, guests, and instructors (e.g., "Saturday Only Package")
   - Set individual dance prices for student and studio billing options for freestyles and solos
   - See [Invoicing](./tasks/Invoicing) for detailed setup

4. **Configure Heat Settings**:
   - Heat interval (typically 90 seconds)
   - Maximum couples per heat (6-8 for competitions, 8-10 for showcases)
   - Age and level mixing preferences
</div>

### Step 2: Set Up Your Dance List
<div class="step" markdown="1">

1. **Add Your Dances**:
   - Add each dance style you'll offer (Waltz, Cha Cha, etc.)
   - Click **Arrange** to organize dances into columns
   - Match your entry form layout using drag-and-drop
   - Save when complete
</div>

### Step 3: Create Your Agenda (Can be done or adjusted later)
<div class="step" markdown="1">

1. **Navigate to Agenda**
2. **Create Categories** for different portions of your event:
   - "Open Smooth"
   - "Closed Rhythm" 
   - "Solos and Formations"
   - "Multi heats"

3. **Assign Dances** to appropriate categories
4. **Set Start Times** for automatic scheduling
</div>

## Phase 2: Registration Period (2-8 weeks)

### Step 4: Invite Studios (Optional)
<div class="step" markdown="1">

**Self-Entry Option**: Allow studios to enter their own students

- Provide studio contact information to receive access
- Studios can manage their own entries and changes
- You maintain oversight and final control

**Organizer Entry**: Enter all participants yourself

 - More control over the process
 - Studios send you entry forms to input
 - Good option for smaller events

</div>

### Step 5: Manage Entries
<div class="step" markdown="1">

1. **Add Studios** (if not already done)
2. **Add People to Studios**:
   - Instructors, students
   - Lead, Follow, (or both)
   - Age and skill levels

3. **Create Entries**:
   - Select leader and follower for each dance
   - Choose appropriate skill level and age category
   - Select dances. If you want mutliple entries for any dance, click on the dance then type a number.

4. **Add Solos**:
   - Select dance (and optional second dance)
   - Enter song information
   - Upload music files for each solo

5. **Add Formations**:
   - Set up as student or click on Add Formation from a studio for studio formations
   - Add all participating dancers
   - Upload choreography music

6. **Handle Changes**:
   - Use [Scratches and Walk-ons](./tasks/Scratches-and-Walk-ons) for last-minute changes
   - Update billing as needed
</div>

## Phase 3: Pre-Event Preparation (1-2 weeks before)

### Step 6: Generate and Review Schedule
<div class="step" markdown="1">

1. **Go to Heats page**
2. **Click Solos** to order your solos
3. **Click Redo** to generate your schedule
4. **Review Results**:
   - Check heat sizes (aim for 4-8 couples). At the bottom of the page is a summary.
   - Verify no scheduling conflicts
   - Look for any problems flagged by the system

4. **Troubleshoot if Needed**:
   - If schedule is too long, see [Scheduling](./tasks/Scheduling) troubleshooting
   - Adjust settings and regenerate as needed
   - Use [Reordering](./tasks/Reordering) for fine-tuning
</div>

### Step 7: Prepare Materials
<div class="step" markdown="1">

1. **Generate Back Numbers**:
   - Go to [Back Numbers](./tasks/Back-Numbers)
   - Assign numbers to all leaders
   - Print number labels

2. **Print Event Materials**:
   - Heat lists for posting
   - Judge sheets (if using paper scoring)
   - Programs for spectators
   - See [Publishing](./tasks/Publishing) for options
</div>

### Step 8: Test Judging Functions
<div class="step" markdown="1">

1. **Tablets or laptops for each judge**

   - **IMPORTANT** Check for browser warning on main page for the event on **each** device. Safari is problematic unlesss you keep up to date with operating system changes; otherwise consider using Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.

2. **Test [Scoring](./tasks/Scoring) system**

  - Finding out at the time of the event that scores or judge comments aren't being saved due to a browser issue will mean that your students won't get the value they are expecting out of the event.

3. **Have paper backup ready**
</div>

## Phase 4: Event Day

### Step 9: Set Up Technology
<div class="step" markdown="1">

1. **Configure Display Systems**:
   - [Counter](./tasks/Counter) display for current heat
   - [Mobile](./tasks/Mobile) access for participants
   - DJ music system if handling audio

2. **Brief Your Team**:
   - Share [Judge](./roles/Judge), [DJ](./roles/DJ), and [Emcee](./roles/Emcee) guides
   - Test all systems before guests arrive
</div>

### Step 10: Run Your Event
<div class="step" markdown="1">

1. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Track current heat on counter display
   - Handle last-minute scratches and walk-ons
   - Assist judges with scoring questions

2. **Manage Real-Time Changes**:

   - Handle equipment issues with backup plans
   - Keep event moving on schedule

3. **Complete Scoring**:

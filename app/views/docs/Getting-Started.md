# Getting Started Guide for Event Organizers

Welcome to the Showcase Application! This guide will walk you through setting up and running your first ballroom dance showcase event from start to finish.

## Before You Begin

This guide assumes you have:
- Received your event ID and set up your password
- Basic familiarity with ballroom dance terminology (see our [Glossary](./Glossary))
- An entry form or list of dances you want to offer

**First time organizing a showcase?** This application handles everything from registration to scoring to heat scheduling automatically. You focus on the dance event - we handle the logistics.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup (1-2 weeks before registration opens)

### Step 1: Configure Event Settings

1. **Navigate to Settings** from your main event page
2. **Fill in Event Details**:
   - Event name, date, location
   - Contact information
   - Registration deadlines
   - Pricing structure

3. **Set Up Packages** (if using invoicing):
   - Create dance packages (e.g., "3-Dance Bronze Package")
   - Set individual dance prices
   - Configure student vs. studio billing options
   - See [Invoicing](./tasks/Invoicing) for detailed setup

4. **Configure Heat Settings**:
   - Heat interval (typically 90 seconds)
   - Maximum couples per heat (6-8 for competitions, 8-10 for showcases)
   - Age and level mixing preferences

### Step 2: Set Up Your Dance List

1. **Go to Dances** from the main page

   - Upload choreography music

### Step 7: Generate and Review Schedule

1. **Go to Heats page**
2. **Click Redo** to generate your schedule
3. **Review Results**:
   - Check heat sizes (aim for 4-8 couples)
   - Verify no scheduling conflicts
   - Look for any problems flagged by the system

4. **Troubleshoot if Needed**:
   - If schedule is too long, see [Scheduling](./tasks/Scheduling) troubleshooting

# Hosting

This application is currently hosted on a Mac Mini in the attic of
my house outside of Raleigh, North Carolina.  Capacity is not an issue,
but power and network failures may temporarily prevent access at times.

I'm currently testing deployment on [fly.io](https://fly.io/) which will
allow me to deploy on servers around the word.

I've provided [installation instructions](https://github.com/rubys/showcase#getting-up-and-running---bare-metal-one-event)
for those that wish to run this themselves.  If you have a machine that is cabable of running a spreadsheet and
a web browser you can run this yourself, but security, backups, and network access will be items you will need
to address.

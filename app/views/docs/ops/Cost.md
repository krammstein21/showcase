# Cost

Yes, this application is truly free in every sense of the word.

The [source code](https://github.com/rubys/showcase#showcase) is available online.
The [license](https://github.com/rubys/showcase/blob/main/LICENSE) is very
straightforward and permissive.

Studios and individual dance companies are welcome to use it on [my servers](./Hosting).  To get started, you will need a [password](./Passwords).

Alternately, you can [install it
yourself](https://github.com/rubys/showcase#getting-up-and-running---bare-metal-one-event),
make changes, contribute your changes back or keep them to yourself.  If you
aren't comfortable doing this yourself, there are plenty of people who you can
hire to do so.

For those that wish to learn how to write an application like this,
this application is written using a framework named
[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and there are plenty of resources
that can you started, including a
[book](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/)
that I have written.

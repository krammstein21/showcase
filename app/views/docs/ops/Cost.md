Yes, this application is truly free in every sense of the word.

The [source code](https://github.com/rubys/showcase#showcase) is available online.
The [license](https://github.com/rubys/showcase/blob/main/LICENSE) is very
straightforward and permissive.

You can install it yourself, make changes, contribute your changes back or keep
them to yourself.  If you aren't comfortable doing this yourself, there are
plenty of people who you can hire to do so.

For those that wish to learn how to write an application like this,
this application is written using a framework named

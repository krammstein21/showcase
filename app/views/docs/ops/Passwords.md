# Passwords

At the moment, only studios and individual dance companies can request access.  The information I need is:

  * A studio name
  * A contact name
  * An email address

Once this is received, I will assign a
user id, and send a password reset request to the email address.  This email will
contain a link to a form that allows the user id to be changed, and a password to be
set.

With a password, you will only be able to access your own events and any event where another studio owner has indicated that you should be granted access.  The only pages that do **not** require a password to
access are the mobile and counter pages.

Passwords can be shared with studio staff, and there is no limit to the number of devices
that can be logged on to the application at one time.  If you forget your password let
me know and I will send another password reset email.  At the present time people without
access can't request a password reset.

While you are encouraged to chose a password that you don't use elsewhere,
passwords are stored in an encrypted form so that they can't be leaked.  This means
that I can't see your password or tell you what it is.

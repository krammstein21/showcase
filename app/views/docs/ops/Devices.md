# Devices

This is a web application that can be accessed by any phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop
capable of running a web browser.

I've tested it on the following: Samsung Android, Apple iPad, Google Chromebook,
Microsoft Windows, and Apple MacOS.

I've also tested it with the following browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari.
Just make sure that your browser is up to date.  This normally isn't a problem
unless you are using Safari on an older macbook where you haven't kept the
operating system up to date.

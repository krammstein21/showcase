# Entries

## Adding entries

 * Add studio(s).  If an owner has multiple studios and instructors from one studio may dance with students from either studio be sure to pair the studios at this time.
 * Add Instructors to the studio first.
 * Add Students.  From a student page, click on Add Heats.
 * Select dance partner, age category, and level.  If the dance partner is another amateur a new selection box will appear allowing you to add an instructor.
 * Click on checkboxes for as many dances as required.  Many dance events limit dances per category to one, but if multiple dances are allowed click on the checkbox and then type a number and the checkbox will be replaced with a numeric entry field.
 * Once complete, click on Create Entry at the bottom of the page.

Solos are added separately.

A student can have multiple entries, possibly with different dance partners, levels, or age categories.  Once an entry is created it will show up on both dance partners pages.

## Changing entries

  * Mass changes are possible by going to a student's page, hovering over the entry, clicking on the edit button and making changes.
  * Smaller changes (like moving a single dance to a different instructor) are possible by hovering over the individual heat, clicking on the edit button and making changes.

# Counter

Events can have one or more displays showing the current heat number.

  * On the settings page you can upload cover art.  Art can either be an image or a video.
  * On the publish page there is a Counter button to show the current heat.  Bring up this page on each display and show the window as full screen.
  * Emcees have a heat button that will allow them to advance to the next heat (and return to previous heats) using arrow keys.  When viewing a heat they can press the space bar to update the counter display.
      * Note: judges can also update the current heat using the space bar
      * Updating the current heat will also advance the heats display for participants that are viewing the schedule using their mobile devices.

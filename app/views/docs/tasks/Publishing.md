Close to event time, go to the Agenda page and click on the lock icon.  This will disable a number of buttons such a redo that can shuffle the schedule.  You will still be able to make more targeted changes - see [Scratches and Walk-ons](./Scratches-and-Walk-ons) for details.

On the publish page there are a number of buttons that will generate reports that can be printed for heat books, judging pages, etc.  Even if you are planning on having judges enter scores in realtime during the application, it is best to print out paper copies in case of application or network failures.  Similarly it is best to have a backup plan for solo music if you are planning to have the DJ stream solos from this site.

For many events, solo scores are hand written only and never entered into the application.  Pages for recording solo scores and comments are included in the Judge Heat Book.

Once the event is complete, there are pages for printing scores.  Individual studios can print their own invoices, heat sheets, and scores from their studio page.

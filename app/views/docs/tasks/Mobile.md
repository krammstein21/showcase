While access to this application is protected by password, there is a single page per event that is open to the public.

Click on publish then heats to see this page.  This shows the agenda and current heat.  It includes a search box that can be used to limit which heats are shown.

From the publish page itself, there is a QRcode that can be used to access this page.  Try it from your phone.

Back on your desktop/laptop, if you click on the QRcode with your mouse you will be taken to a page that you can print and post to the walls or leave on tables.

# Scheduling

The scheduling system automatically generates heats (competitive dance sessions) based on your entries, settings, and agenda configuration. This guide explains how to create and manage your event schedule.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the **Heats** page
2. Click the **Redo** button to generate/regenerate the schedule
3. Review the generated heats and make adjustments as needed

## Understanding the Scheduling Process

The scheduler uses a two-pass algorithm:
- **First pass**: Minimizes the total number of heats while respecting your constraints
- **Second pass**: Balances heat sizes for better flow and judging

### What the Scheduler Considers

1. **Dancer Conflicts**: Ensures no dancer is scheduled in two places at once
2. **Studio Conflicts**: Prevents studio representatives from competing against each other (if configured)
3. **Age/Level Mixing**: Controls whether beginners and advanced dancers compete together
4. **Heat Size Limits**: Respects minimum and maximum couples per heat
5. **Dance Order**: Interleaves different dance styles within categories

## Configuring Schedule Settings

### Global Settings (Settings → Heats Tab)

- **Heat Interval**: Time between the start of consecutive heats (e.g., 90 seconds)
- **Minimum Couples**: Smallest allowed heat size (typically 1-2)
- **Maximum Couples**: Largest allowed heat size (typically 6-8)
- **Mix Levels**: Whether newcomers and advanced dancers can compete together
- **Mix Ages**: Whether different age groups can compete together

### Per-Category Settings (Agenda Page)

Each agenda category can override global settings:
- Set specific heat size limits for categories
- Control mixing rules for specific portions of your event
- Add start times to calculate scheduled times for all heats

## Step-by-Step Scheduling

### 1. Prepare Your Data

Before scheduling:
- Ensure all entries are complete
- Verify dancer information is correct
- Set up your agenda categories
- Configure any special dance categories (multi-dance, championships)

### 2. Configure Settings

1. Go to **Settings → Heats**
2. Set your preferred heat interval (time between heats)
3. Configure minimum/maximum couples per heat
4. Decide on level/age mixing rules
5. Save your settings

### 3. Set Up Agenda

1. Navigate to **Agenda**
2. Create categories for different portions of your event (e.g., "Morning Bronze", "Afternoon Silver")
3. Assign dances to appropriate categories
4. Set start times for categories to generate a timed schedule
5. Override heat limits for specific categories if needed

### 4. Generate Schedule

1. Go to **Heats**
2. Click **Redo** to generate the schedule
3. The system will:
   - Group entries into heats
   - Assign heat numbers
   - Calculate times (if start times are set)
   - Interleave dance styles

### 5. Review and Adjust

After generation:
- Check heat sizes are appropriate
- Verify no scheduling conflicts
- Look for any unusually small or large heats
- Use manual reordering if needed (see [Reordering](./Reordering))

## Common Scenarios

### Scheduling a Small Studio Showcase

1. Use larger maximum heat sizes (8-10 couples)
2. Enable level mixing to combine heats
3. Set shorter heat intervals (60-75 seconds)

### Scheduling a Large Multi-Studio Event

1. Use standard heat sizes (6-8 couples max)
2. Disable level mixing for fair competition
3. Set standard intervals (90 seconds)
4. Use multiple ballrooms if needed (see [Ballrooms](./Ballrooms))

### Scheduling with Solos and Formations

1. Solos are scheduled within their assigned categories
2. Order solos on the [Solos](./Solos) page before scheduling
3. The scheduler respects manual solo ordering
4. Formations follow the same rules as solos

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot create valid schedule"
- Too many constraints (try relaxing level/age mixing)
- Heat size limits too restrictive
- Check for entries with impossible conflicts

### Heats Too Small/Large
- Adjust minimum/maximum couple settings
- Enable/disable level mixing
- Check category-specific overrides

### Schedule Takes Too Long
- **Single person with too many entries**: Often an instructor with many students creates a bottleneck (they can only be on the floor once per heat)
- **Settings too restrictive**: Allow more couples on the floor, move age/level sliders right to enable mixing, consider allowing open/closed mixing
- **Heat interval too long**: Reduce the time between start of consecutive heats

### Dancers in Wrong Order
- Check dance assignments to categories
- Verify agenda category order
- Look for category overrides on specific dances

## Best Practices

1. **Schedule Early, Adjust Often**: Generate an initial schedule early, then refine as entries change
2. **Use Categories Wisely**: Break your event into logical sections (by level, time of day)
3. **Monitor Heat Sizes**: Aim for consistent heat sizes for better flow
4. **Plan for Changes**: Keep some flexibility for last-minute entries and scratches
5. **Test Settings**: Try different configurations to find what works for your event

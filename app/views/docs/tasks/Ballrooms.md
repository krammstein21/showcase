# Ballrooms

Some of the bigger events partition the ballroom floor with stanchions and ropes for all or part of the agenda.

The application currently supports only splitting the floor into two.  Settings for the entire event can be made from the settings page, and can be overridden on an agenda item by item basis.

The ballroom, A or B, will show up on heat lists, mobile pages, judge's scoring pages, and emcee pages.

When adding [walk-on participants](./Scratches-and-Walk-ons) after the agenda is locked, you can select the ballroom for new participants.

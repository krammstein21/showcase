# Scoring

On the settings page there are a number of settings for controlling scoring.  Closed scoring defaults to metalist (GH/G/S/B) unless open scoring is set to numeric.

Clicking on a judge name from the main page from your event will provide access to a number of buttons, the first two for entering scores, then some for generating reports, and finally buttons to edit the information for the judge or to return to the "Event Staff" studio.

Whether the judge is going to be entering scores during the event or a scribe is going to do so either in batches or after the event complete, either of the Scoring buttons can be used interchangeably.

Score by cards shows participants on cards that can be moved about the page.  Score by radio (buttons) shows a more conventional textual ordering (you can select whether this is ordered by back numbers or level), and scores are entered by clicking on buttons.  Chose the option that works best for you.  In fact, different judges can chose different options or even change their choice between heats.

Access to summary of results can be obtained either from an individual judge page or from the summary page.

# Scoring

The scoring system supports multiple scoring methods and provides real-time score entry for judges during events. This guide covers setup, scoring methods, and managing results.

## Scoring Configuration

### Settings Overview

Navigate to **Settings** to configure your scoring system:

- **Scoring Method**: Choose between medalist scoring (GH/G/S/B) or numeric scoring (1-100 points)
- **Closed vs Open**: Closed scoring defaults to medalist unless you specifically enable numeric scoring
- **Judge Assignment**: Configure which judges score which categories
- **Real-time Updates**: Enable live score broadcasting to displays

### Scoring Types

1. **Medalist Scoring**: Traditional Gold Hand/Gold/Silver/Bronze system
2. **Numeric Scoring**: Point-based scoring (typically 1-100)
3. **Placement Scoring**: Ranking system (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)

## Judge Interface Access

### Setting Up Judges

1. **Add Judges**: Go to **People** → **Add New** → Select "Judge" type
2. **Judge Information**: Enter name, contact details, and expertise level
3. **Assign Categories**: Determine which dance categories each judge will score

### Judge Login Process

**From Main Event Page**:
1. Click on a **judge name** to access their personal scoring interface
2. The judge page displays several key sections:
   - **Scoring Buttons** (primary interface)
   - **Report Generation** options
   - **Judge Information** editing
   - **Return to Event Staff** navigation

## Scoring Interface Options

Judges can choose between two scoring interfaces based on their preference:

### Method 1: Score by Cards

**Visual Interface**:
- Participants displayed as **moveable cards** on the screen
- Each card shows:
  - Couple names (Lead/Follow)
  - Back numbers
  - Studio affiliation
  - Current score status

**Interaction**:
- **Drag and drop** cards to reorder placements
- **Click cards** to assign scores
- **Visual feedback** shows scoring progress
- Ideal for judges who prefer spatial organization

### Method 2: Score by Radio Buttons

**Text-Based Interface**:
- **Conventional list format** showing all participants
- Sorting options:
  - **By back numbers** (numerical order)
  - **By skill level** (grouped by experience)
  - **Alphabetical** by participant names

**Interaction**:
- **Radio buttons** or **dropdown menus** for score selection
- **Clear tabular layout** with participant information
- **Immediate saving** of score selections
- Better for judges comfortable with traditional scoresheets

## Scoring Workflow

### During the Event

1. **Heat Preparation**:
   - System displays current heat information
   - Judge sees list of competing couples
   - Previous scores (if any) are pre-loaded

2. **Live Scoring**:
   - Enter scores in real-time as couples perform
   - Scores save automatically with internet connection
   - Visual indicators show completion status

3. **Heat Completion**:
   - Review all scores before finalizing
   - Submit completed heat scores
   - Move to next heat automatically

### Flexible Usage

**Real-time vs Batch Entry**:
- **During Event**: Judges score live as heats progress
- **Batch Entry**: Scribe enters scores from paper sheets later
- **Post-Event**: Complete scoring after event concludes
- **Mixed Approach**: Combine live and batch scoring as needed

**Interface Switching**:
- Judges can **change between card and radio interfaces** at any time
- **Different judges** can use different methods simultaneously
- **Switch between heats** if one method works better for specific categories

## Results and Reports

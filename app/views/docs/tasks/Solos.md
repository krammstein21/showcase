# Solos

Solos are different from other heats beyond the obvious: only one set of participants are on the floor.

## Quick start

 * Enter solos by navigating to a student and clicking the "Add solo" or "Add formation" buttons.
 * Edit solos by navigating to a student or instructor, move the cursor hover over either entry in the Solos list or Heats list and click on the edit button.  At the bottom of each studio page is also a Solo button that shows all the solos for this studio and paired studios - from this page you can also play the uploaded music and edit buttons will appear if you over over a solo.
 * Add solos to the agenda by creating or editing a category and checking solo dances to be included in that category in the "SOLOS CATEGORY" section.
 * Order solos by going to the Heats page, clicking the Solos button, and using drag and drop to rearrange the order.
 * If you have added a DJ to the event, clicking on the DJ's name from the front page will take you to a page with a Solo button.  Clicking on that button will take you to a page which shows all of the solos in order and with controls that enable you to play the music.

## Details

 * When you add a solo you can list two dances; the name of the song and the artist, and upload the song file itself.  If you upload a song file it will be made available to the DJ who will be able to stream the song directly from the showcase server at the event.
 * Formations are solos with additional people on the floor.  The first two dancers are the ones that will be invoiced for the heat, and must consist of a leader and a follower.  Instructors can be listed as being on the dance floor with the students or simply receiving credit for the dance.
 * If participating studios are given access, their staff can upload music for solos otherwise doing so is the responsibility of event organizers.  Once uploaded songs can be accesses and played by the DJ at the event.
 * Typically solos grouped by category (e.g., Smooth, Rhythm, Specialty, Country, etc.) and are separate agenda items.  If solos and freestyles are grouped in the same agenda item, freestyles are danced first then solos.
 * In order to accommodate costume changes, the ordering of solos is entirely determined by the event organizer.

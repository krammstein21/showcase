# Scratches and Walk Ons

Things always come up at the last minute which will require changes after you've gone to print.

Even if you've clicked the lock button on agenda page once you have gone to print (and it is highly recommended that you do so), you can continue to add remove entries, either by editing entries or individual heats.  See [Changing Entries](./Entries#changing-entries) for more information.

The key difference is that you will **not** want to click on redo on either the heats or agenda page as that will change the schedule.  Instead you will find that new entries are assigned to heat zero.  Edit the individual heat and change the heat number.  Take care not to double book a student or add a different dance to an existing heat.  You have complete control here, and with great power comes great responsibility.

Heat numbers in this application are numeric, but should you wish to split a heat or reorder a solo, feel free to assign heat numbers with decimals (such as `40.1`).

As an alternative to editing indidivual heat numbers, you can use drag and drop with individual couples.  This is
more convenient, but generally only works well if the heats are close together.

If, by accident, you schedule the same person on the floor twice in one heat, that name will show up in red.

Judges, Emcees, DJs and participants using the mobile application will see the live version of the schedule.  For example, if there is a scratch the Emcee will see "5 couples on the floor" if there previously were 6.

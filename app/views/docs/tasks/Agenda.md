# Agenda

Agenda for events typically have individual slots for dance categories (e.g. smooth, rhythm, country, specialty); further subdivided by open / closed / solo; etc.  You can move agenda items around via drag and drop, so if you want open country dances first, followed by open smooth, etc., place these agenda items in the order you want.

Within a category heats are ordered by the order of dances on the dance page, which again you can rearrange via drag and drop.  Normally dances are intermixed (waltz, then tango, then foxtrot, then viennese, then this pattern repeats), but you can uncheck "intermixed" in settings to do all waltzes, then all foxtrots, etc.

## Adding an agenda item

 * From the front page click on the agenda button, then on new category.
 * Optionally add a start date and time.  It is important that the first agenda item have a start date and time.  For agenda items that are expected to start immediately after the previous item, leave these fields blank.  To add either an intra-day break or a end of day break add a start time to the agenda item that will start after the break.
 * You can also specify a minumum duration, and add agenda items with no dances.  This can be useful for breaks, general dancing, awards, etc..
 * Click customize ballroom and heat size if you want these values to be different than the overall event for this category.
 * Select dances by category to be included in this agenda item.
 * Click create category at the bottom of the page.

If you have heat entries entered and have set times between heats in the settings, there is a redo button at the top of the agenda page that allows you to schedule heats.

## Making changes

 * If you click on an agenda item you can edit any field and click on Update category at the bottom.
     * If you add a dance that was previously in another category it will be removed from that category.
 * To reorder the agenda, use drag and drop
 * If you add or edit new dances later, you can select categories at that time or return back to the agenda.

See [Scratches and Walk-ons](./Scratches-and-Walk-ons) for making last minute changes.

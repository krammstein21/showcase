# Agenda

Agenda for events typically have individual slots for dance categories (e.g. smooth, rhythm, country, specialty); further subdivided by open / closed / solo; etc.

## Adding an agenda item

 * From the front page click on the agenda button, then on new category.
 * Optionally add a start date and time.  It is important that the first agenda item have a start date and time.  For agenda items that are expected to start immediately after the previous item, leave these fields blank.  To add either an intra-day break or a end of day break add a start time to the agenda item that will start after the break.
 * Click customize ballroom and heat size if you want these values to be different than the overall event for this category.
 * Select dances by category to be included in this agenda item.
 * Click create category at the bottom of the page.

If you have heat entries entered and have set times between heats in the settings, there is a redo button at the top of the agenda page that allows you to schedule heats.

## Making changes

 * If you click on an agenda item you can edit any field and click on Update category at the bottom.
     * If you add a dance that was previously in another category it will be removed from that category.
 * To reorder the agenda, use drag and drop
 * If you add or edit new dances later, you can select categories at that time or return back to the agenda.

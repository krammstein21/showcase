# Agenda

Agenda for events typically have individual slots for dance categories (e.g. smooth, rhythm, country, specialty); further subdivided by open / closed / solo; etc.  You can move agenda items around via drag and drop, so if you want open country dances first, followed by open smooth, etc., place these agenda items in the order you want.

Within a category heats are ordered by the order of dances on the dance page, which again you can rearrange via drag and drop.  Normally dances are intermixed (Waltz, then Tango, then Foxtrot, then Viennese, then this pattern repeats), but you can uncheck "intermixed" in settings to do all waltzes, then all foxtrots, etc.

## Adding an agenda item

 * From the front page click on the agenda button, then on new category.
 * Optionally add a start date and time.  It is important that the first agenda item have a start date and time.  For agenda items that are expected to start immediately after the previous item, leave these fields blank.  To add either an intra-day break or a end of day break add a start time to the agenda item that will start after the break.
 * You can also specify a minimum duration, and add agenda items with no dances.  This can be useful for breaks, general dancing, awards, etc..
 * Depending on your _Match entry forms to agenda?_ setting, you can either create a category for routines or as many categories as you like separate from the main agenda.
   Either way, dances listed in these categories aren't exclusive to this category and can be repeated in categories which do not check this box.
 * Click customize ballroom and heat size if you want these values to be different than the overall event for this category.
 * You can also specify that you want an agenda item to be split after a specified number of heats.  In this field you can even provide multiple numbers if you want a different number of heats in different splits.
   If you have more heats than you provide numbers for, the last number is considered repeating.
 * Select dances by category to be included in this agenda item.
 * Click create category at the bottom of the page.

If you have heat entries entered and have set times between heats in the settings, there is a redo button at the top of the agenda page that allows you to schedule heats.

## Pro shows and Pro heats<a id=pro></a>

Some events will have professional shows and professional heats.  This can be enabled by
checking the "Include pro heats?" option in the settings.

Once enabled, you will need to define one or more agenda categories which have the
"Professionals only?" option checked for that category.  As with amateur categories,
check the dances are available for that category.

Finally, create entries, solos, and formations by going to the page for a professional
participant in the event.  When creating entries for freestyle heats, only the dances
that were previously defined in a professional category will be available for selection.

## Agenda first option<a id="agenda-first"></a>

Most people get started by entering dances and organizing the agenda later; but you can go the other way too: start by defining the agenda first and then entering dances.  The advantage of doing the agenda first is that you can have (for example) open waltz in multiple agenda categories - only once in agenda items that aren't specifically marked as separate from the main program, but as many entries that are marked as separate as you want.

This often is useful if you desire separate agenda items for newcomers or for youths.

If you want this:

 * Select the following option in the settings: "Match entry forms to agenda?"
 * In each agenda item that you want to have a separate set of dances, select: "Separate set of dances from main program"

## Making changes

 * If you click on an agenda item you can edit any field and click on Update category at the bottom.
     * If you add a dance that was previously in another category it will be removed from that category.
 * To reorder the agenda, use drag and drop
 * If you add or edit new dances later, you can select categories at that time or return back to the agenda.

See [Scratches and Walk-ons](./Scratches-and-Walk-ons) for making last minute changes.

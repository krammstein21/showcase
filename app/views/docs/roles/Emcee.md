# Emcee

The event organizer can add one or more Emcees on the settings page.
Emcee names show up on the front page of the event.  Clicking
on a Emcee name will take you to a page with actions and reports
that are of interest to Emcee.

On this page is a button that will take you to a list of heats.
Clicking on a heat will take you to a page with more information
about that heat including the number of couples.  The left and right arrow
buttons can be used to advance to the previous and next heats.  Clicking on the
Heat at the top will take you back to the heat list which is useful if heats
ever are done out of order.

Pressing the space bar on a page with an individual heat will update
monitors containing the heat number and will cause lists shown on
mobile devices to advance.

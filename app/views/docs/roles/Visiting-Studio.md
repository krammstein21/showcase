# Visiting Studios

Studios will be assigned a user id, and will be sent an email to reset their password.
Feel free to share that user and password with studio staff.

Event databases are backed up, and every access is authenticated and logged.  If for any
reason you lose control of your id, let us know and your password will be reset and
the logs will be examined and unapproved changes will be undone.

Each event has a home page.  You are encouraged to bookmark this page in your browser.  Feel free
to access this page anywhere: desktop, laptop, tablet, and even your phone.

## Entries

Look for a green Studios button.  This will take you to where you will do most of your work.
See [Entries](../tasks/Entries) for more information.

## Reports

At the bottom of the page for each studio are buttons to generate reports.  From here you
can see an invoice for your studio as well as invoices you can send to your students.
Heat sheets and scores can be obtained from here too.

# DJ

The event organizer can add one or more DJs on the settings page.
DJ names show up on the front page of the event.  Clicking
on a DJ name will take you to a page with actions and reports
that are of interest to DJs.

If Studios uploaded songs for solos, they can be accessed and
played by pressing the solos button on a DJ page.

A second button will take you to a list of heats, and this list
will show the dance for each heat.

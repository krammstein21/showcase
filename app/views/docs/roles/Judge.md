# Judge

The event organizer adds one or more judges on the settings page.
Judges names show up on the front page of the event.  Clicking
on a judge name will take you to a page with actions and reports
that are of interest to judges.

Judges can either enter scores directly into the application or
record scores on paper for later data entry.  Event organizers
will configure this using settings, and will print judge heat
books from the publish page.

See [Scoring](../tasks/Scoring) for more information on online
scoring.

If you have multiple judges and large heat sizes, you might want to
enable _Assign judges couples to evaluate?_ in the settings.  If enabled,
this will add an _On floor_ checkbox and _Assign judges_ button on every
judge page.

Before the event begins, uncheck _On floor_ for every backup judge, then
click _Assign judges_ once.  Use the _Score heats - radio_ interface.
The couples assigned to you will be at the top of the list with their
back numbers circled in red.  There will also be a blank space separating
your assignments and the remaining couples on the floor.

Assignments are just a suggestion - nothing prevents you from judging
additional couples or different couples entirely.

If a judge goes on break, return to the judge's page and uncheck _On floor_
for that judge.  If there is a backup judge to replace them, check _On floor_
for their replacement.  Once complete, push _Assign judges_.  Only heats that
have yet to be judged will have their assignments changed.  Feel free to
repeat this process as many times as necessary during the course of the event.

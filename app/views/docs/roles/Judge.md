# Judge

The event organizer adds one or more judges on the settings page.
Judges names show up on the front page of the event.  Clicking
on a judge name will take you to a page with actions and reports
that are of interest to judges.

Judges can either enter scores directly into the application or
record scores on paper for later data entry.  Event organizers
will configure this using settings, and will print judge heat
books from the publish page.

See [Scoring](../tasks/Scoring) for more information on online
scoring.

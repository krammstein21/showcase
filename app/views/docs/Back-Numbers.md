In most events, leaders wear back numbers.

 * On the settings page there is a checkbox which can be unchecked if your event will **not** be using back numbers.
 * Normally you won't need to set back numbers when adding either a student or instructor leader -- you can leave this blank.
 * When it is time to go to print there is a "backs" button on the main page of the event.
     * If you scroll to the bottom of that page there is a form which will enable you to set all the back numbers.
     * If you add participants after you go to print, you can assign a number at that time.

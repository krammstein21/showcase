# Compmgnr

[Compmngr](https://www.douglassassociates.com/) is a computer program for managing ballroom dance competitions; much like this one.  You may be
interested in migrating from Compmngr to this tool; or there may be some
features that you want to use from Compmngr, and others you want to use
from this one.

Compmngr has the ability to export heats in a variety of formats. I've
written a script that can be used to import people, dances, and entries
from exports in `xlsx` and `txt` formats.

These scripts were written without the benefit of any documentation, but
they have been used successfully in a single event.  Undoubtedly this
script will need to be modified when the next event's export is processed.
Over time, it will become more resilient.

But for now, the process is to email me the export and have me run the
script for you.  Once I'm confident that it will handle most cases there
will be an option (probably on the Advanced settings page) for you to
run this yourself.

I've never run Compmngr myself and I'm not likely to.  I'm looking for
somebody who has used this program to write down the instructions on how
to find the right export function so that I can include that on the
page containing the input form.

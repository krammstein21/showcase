# Internationalization

Different locations around the world use different languages, and different ways of formatting dates, times, and currency.

I've taken the first step and let you enter start and end dates for your event using your browser's localization features,
and this includes selecting a date using a calendar.  I'm looking to do more.

Outputs will be produced using the locale of your studio. If you have events that span different locales, I can create
additional studios for you so that you can control which locale settings are used by requesting new events in the
studio that matches the locale you desire.

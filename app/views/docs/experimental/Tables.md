# Tables - Optimal Seating Assignments

The Tables feature enables you to arrange seating for your event.

Start by going to the Studios page and clicking the Tables button. From there, set the default table size. If some tables are a different size, you can set a different size for those tables.

Try the button to automatically assign people to tables. It tries to seat studios together, along with their paired studios. If you don't like the results, click Reset to remove all tables and start over.

You can also add tables individually and select a studio to seat people from. If you have unfilled seats, you can click on the table and add another studio.

The Arrange Tables feature enables you to drag tables to match the room layout.

Renumber will assign new numbers left to right, then top to bottom. If you would like a different numbering, you can go back to the Tables page, click on a table, and change its number.

Once done, return to the Studios page to see table assignments. If a studio has multiple tables, you can click on the tables column on this page to see those tables, and from there you can drag and drop people to move them to a different table.

If you edit a person, you can see and change the table the person is seated at, or change it so that the person is not assigned to any table.

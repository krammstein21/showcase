# Scrutineering

Scrutineering is a feature commonly found in larger competitions where
students register for multiple heats, are called back, and then are
ranked in successive semi-final rounds culminating in a final round.

The [rules for rankings are complex](https://www.dancepartner.com/articles/dancesport-skating-system.asp), but computers excel at handling them.
Rule 11, for example, can be tedious and error-prone when done by hand, especially under the time pressure of a live competition.
Having a computer act as the scrutineer can produce instant results.

To enable a multi-heat to be scrutineered, check the **Scrutineering?** button on that dance. When checked:

* All entries for this dance will be treated as a single heat, with semi-final rounds when needed. This means that participants (particularly instructors) can only select one partner for this dance.
* If a semi-final round is needed, judges will see checkboxes they can use to select couples to be called back.
* For final rounds, judges will see a list of couples in rank order. They can use drag and drop to reorder this list. The list will initially be shown in a random order for each judge.
* Results can be found by going to the Summary page and selecting **Multi-Scores**. Clicking on **All Scores** on that page will show the rankings for each dance in the multi-dance.
